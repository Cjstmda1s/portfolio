                                    web application designed to display random dog pictures on demand.
                                    Built using React, it fetches images from the Dog CEO API and updates the display
                                    instantly when the user clicks a buttonâ€”no page reload required. The app uses React
                                    components to structure the UI, including the image container, fetch button, and loading indicator.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The project originally started with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was later
                                    refactored into a React application to improve modularity and state management.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I faced challenges understanding how asynchronous API calls worked within React,
                                    especially with useEffect and useState. There were also issues managing the loading state,
                                    but after experimenting and reorganizing some code, I eventually got the app to work.
